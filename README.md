## Problem Statement

Choosing a career path is one of life's most important decisions, and it can be overwhelming. Many individuals face the following challenges:

- **Lack of Clarity**: Students often lack clarity about their interests and strengths, making it difficult to choose an appropriate career path.

- **Mismatched Career Choices**: Professionals sometimes find themselves in careers that do not align with their passions and skills, leading to job dissatisfaction.

## Solution
